## Citibike Back End

This is an app that serves to fetch (and cache) data from various
sources as necessary and return them to the front end app. It's a simple
proxy to avoid CORS issues and be friendly to the data services the
front end app depends.

## Getting Started

Clone the app

Run `bundle install`

Start it up with `bundle exec shotgun`

View bike data by viewing in the browser: `localhost:9393/station-status`
